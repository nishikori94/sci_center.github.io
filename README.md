## WELCOME TO THE SCIENTIFIC MANAGMENT SYSTEM PROJECT PAGE

This is web-based management software system used by editors, reviewers and scientists to organise scientific paper submissions and reviews. On the other side it is used by customers to buy and access the papers and articles.

It is made up of several separate projects:

- Payment hub: provides an integrated infrastructure for all payment types and allows you to combine and normalise financial messages from disparate systems to stabilise payment flows and reduce operational risk. 
    - [Payment hub client](https://github.com/nishikori94/KoncentratorPlacanjaClient)
    - [Payment hub server](https://github.com/nishikori94/KoncentratorPlacanja)

- Science center: it is used by customers to buy and access the papers and articles.
    - [Science center client](https://github.com/nishikori94/NaucnaCentralaClient)
    - [Science center server](https://github.com/nishikori94/NaucnaCentrala)
